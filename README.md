The Doctor Appointment Management System is a well-structured, user-friendly Java Swing application designed to streamline the management of doctors, patients, and their appointments. It features an intuitive graphical interface with the following core modules:

Doctor Registration Panel – Allows users to input and register doctor profiles, including name, gender, specialization, and year of MBBS graduation. All registered doctors are automatically listed in a neatly formatted table for easy reference.

Patient Registration Panel – Facilitates the registration of patients by capturing essential details such as name, gender, age, and illness. The patient list is displayed in a dynamic table, offering clear visibility of all records.

Appointment Scheduling Panel – Enables users to conveniently schedule appointments by selecting a doctor and patient, along with the desired date and time (in AM/PM format). Each appointment entry is recorded in a detailed table, displaying serial number, doctor name, patient name, appointment date and time, and consultation fee.

Built using the CardLayout manager, the system offers seamless panel switching and a visually appealing design, enhanced by customized components and consistent color themes. This application is ideal for small clinics or educational projects demonstrating practical use of Java Swing for real-world system simulation.
