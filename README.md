The Doctor Appointment Management System is a Java Swing-based GUI application that allows users to manage doctors, patients, and appointments efficiently. It includes three main modules:

Doctor Registration Panel – Lets users register new doctors by entering their name, gender, specialization, and MBBS year. Registered doctors are shown in a table.

Patient Registration Panel – Enables registration of patients by capturing their name, gender, disease, and age. Patients are also displayed in a table.

Appointment Panel – Allows users to create appointments by selecting a doctor, patient, date (day and month), and time (AM/PM format). All scheduled appointments are listed in a table with details like doctor, patient, date, time, and fee.

The application uses card layout for smooth navigation between panels and styled components for a clean and user-friendly interface.
